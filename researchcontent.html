          <h4><a href="GRC2024.pdf" download> EPS 10 Field Trip Guide</a></h4>
          <p> A short expository guide for a geology day trip in central Massachusetts.</p>
        </li>
		<li>
          <h4><a href="GRC2024.pdf" download> Synthesis and Characterization of Metastable Tetragonal UTe<sub>2</sub> at Ambient Conditions</a></h4>
          <p> My conference poster from the 2024 Gordon High Pressure Conference. Results shown are preliminary and have not been reviewed.</p>

          <h4><a href="Unit_cell_calc.ipynb" download> Unit cell calculator</a></h4>
          <p> A Jupyter Notebook that calculates unit cell parameters (with uncertainties) for a crystal of any lattice system given observed X-ray powder diffraction peaks. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="Partitioning.pdf" download> An Analytical Method for Calculating Metal–Silicate Partitioning</a></h4>
          <p> From an imposed starting composition (and oxygen fugacity) it's easy to determine how much iron enters the metallic phase.</p>

          <h4><a href="BMderivation.pdf" download> Derivation of the Birch&ndash;Murnaghan Equation of State </a></h4>
          <p> By far the most useful thing on this site. I couldn't find a worked derivation anywhere, so I made one. Afterwards, I happened across <a href="https://katsurabgi.jimdo.com/english-home/lecture-note/bm3-eos/">this</a> slightly different derivation by Tomoo Katsura.</p>
